"""
Two ways to approach this problem, the first approach is what I naturally
came to, where we need to assume a value for the first item in the array.

The second approach a trick we can implement to finish the algorithm faster.

        To be able to complete this algorithm, we start from derived[0], at this point, we have

            - original[0] (unknown)

        We have 3 variables and 2 unknowns, however, every item in the array is binary so we

        Observe the following equations that represent the relationship
        between the elements of the derived and original arrays:

        derived[0] = original[0] XOR original[1]

        Each element in original appears exactly twice in the
        equations: once as original[i] and once as original[i+1].

        For example:

        original[0] appears in derived[0] (original[0] XOR original[1])
        original[0] also appears in derived[n-1] (original[n-1] XOR original[0])
        Since XOR is both commutative and associative, the order doesnâ€™t
        matter. When all occurrences of original[i] are XORed together,
        they cancel each other out:

        original[0] XOR original[0] XOR original[1] XOR original[1] ... = 0

        If the derived array is valid (i.e., it was generated from some original),
        then the XOR of all elements in derived must be 0. This is because all elements
        of original cancel out when XORed.
